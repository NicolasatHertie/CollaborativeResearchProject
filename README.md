### Instructions and background information on our repository:

In addition to the Readme file, our repository "CollaborativeResearchProject" contains two BibTeX files, an RMD file, a PDF file and an HTML file. The PDF and the HTML were created using the knit function of R Studio. 
The referenced literature can be found in the BibTeX file "Literature.bib". The R Packages used for the proposal are cited in the BibTeX file "RPackages.bib". As the BibTeX files and the RMD file are dynamically linked, it is important to save all three files in the same folder when trying to run the RMD file.

The focus of our research is the identification of the determinants of HIV/AIDS and we propose 3 models to test what factors influence HIV/AIDS incidence and prevalence at the macro and micro level. All the literature utilized for this research can be publicly accessed. Furthermore, clarification of key concepts is provided via hyperlinks. 

We have mostly used data from the World Bank, Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) and AIDS Indicator Surveys (AIS). It should be noted that an authorization is required to access the last two sources. However, our research provides a detailed explanation of the information used and descriptive statistics of these sources. 

All files follow the same structure:

1. Preparation
2. Introduction
3. Aim, Research Question and Hypotheses
4. Literature Review
5. Data Sources
6. Methodology and Data Analysis
7. Limitations
8. Bibliography
9. Appendix

# Task for the assignment

The task for this assignment was to write a research proposal that:

+ States the research question and justifies why it is interesting.
+ Includes a basic literature review (properly cited with BibTeX).
+ Identifies data sources and appropriate research methodologies 
for answering the research question.

The focus of the research proposal should be 

+ clearly identify and cite your intended data sources

+ describe what format the data is currently in and how we intend to clean it up so that it is usable for statistical analysis

+ given our data and research question, what types of descriptive and inferential statistics are appropriate and feasible for us to answer our question (be as specific as possible including possibly looking up R functions and packages that implement these statistics).

### Deadline for submission:

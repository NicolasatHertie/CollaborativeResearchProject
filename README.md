### Instructions and background information on our repository:
Our repository "CollaborativeResearchProject" contains one R code, a PDF file and an HTML file. The PDF and the HTML were created using the knit function of R Studio. 

All the literature utilized for the research can be publicly accessed and the documents contain hyperlinks to the sources. 

The code 'CodeNico' works with the data set called women which describes the average heights and weights for American women aged 30 to 39. The code 'CodeMeilin' works with the data set infert which describes infertility after spontaneous and induced abortions.

Both codes are structured according to the following logic:

1. Setting the working directory and load packages
2. Dynamically linking the files (only for 'CodeNico')
3. Choosing the data set
4. Exploring the data set
5. Providing descripitive statistics

### Pull Requests

We did some minor changes to the File Henryjean/Pair-Assignment-1 of Owen and Thierry and created a pull request.


# Further Informations on the Tasks

Each pair will create a new public GitHub repository. It must be fully documented, 
including with a descriptive README.md file. Your code must be human readable and 
clearly commented.

Each pair should include R source code files that:
+ Access at least two core R data sets
+ Illustrate the datas’ distributions using a variety of relevant
descriptive statistics
+ Two files must be dynamically linked

Another pair makes a pull request. And this is discussed/merged.

### Learning objectives: 
Develop your understanding of: 
+ File structures,
+ Version control,
+ Basic R data structures and descriptive statistics.

### Deadline for submission:
Midnight, 26th September
